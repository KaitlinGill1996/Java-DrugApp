# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Generic Drugs and Classes

**Proposal**:
- *What will the application do?*

This application will allow you to select a drug class (ex. ACE Inhibitors, Statins) and find the available brand
and generic names for each drug in the class. It will contain an option to create a 'saved' or 'favourited' list of 
drugs to allow you to quickly access these when required (and may 
potentially include the reference drug pricing through PharmaCare,
if applicable).

- *Who will use it?*

This would be a useful app for many healthcare professionals,
especially pharmacists, as a quick reference when working.
It will aid in finding a specific generic that a patient
may request or just allow you to see which available generics there
are - in case you need to check for certain filler ingredients or
compare ingredients for patients who have had previous adverse reactions to other generics.

- *Why is this project of interest to you?*
 
As a practicing pharmacist (and aspiring computer science
degree holder), this allows a blend of the two fields I am
interested in. There have been countless times I have
been in a clinical setting and a physician has
mentioned an old brand name that I need to quickly look
up or if I am trying to avoid an allergen for a patient,
this will allow me to look up the monographs for the
available drugs. It has clinical utility and will hopefully
aid me in learning Java and how to program.

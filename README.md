- *What does the application do?*

This application will allow you to create a list of drugs (grouped in whichever way you wish)
and then return either the cheapest, or most expensive drug within the list. You can also return
all the drugs from the same class within the list. You can edit and structure the list in the manner of
your own choosing and use it as a quick reference.


This would be a useful app for many healthcare professionals,
especially pharmacists. Other healthcare professionals can also
use it to help group common drugs they use.
 
As a practicing pharmacist (and aspiring computer science
degree holder), this allows a blend of the two fields I am
interested in. It allows me to make my own list of commonly used
drugs in my practice and access information about them quickly. I have the freedom to add
drugs of my choosing and use the appropriate brand name for the setting I am working in.

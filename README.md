# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Generic Drugs and Classes

**Proposal**:
- *What will the application do?*

This application will allow you to create a list of drugs (grouped in whichever way you wish)
and then return either the cheapest, or most expensive drug within the list. You can also return
all the drugs from the same class within the list. You can edit and structure the list in the manner of
your own choosing and use it as a quick reference.

- *Who will use it?*

This would be a useful app for many healthcare professionals,
especially pharmacists, as a quick reference when working. Other healthcare professionals can also
use it to help group common drugs they use.

- *Why is this project of interest to you?*
 
As a practicing pharmacist (and aspiring computer science
degree holder), this allows a blend of the two fields I am
interested in. It allows me to make my own list of commonly used
drugs in my practice and access information about them quickly. I have the freedom to add
drugs of my choosing and use the appropriate brand name for the setting I am working in.

User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to create a new drug and add it to a list of favourite drugs
- As a user, I want to be able to view the drugs inside my list of favourite drugs
- As a user, I want to be able to return the most expensive drug (by unit price) in my list of drugs
- As a user, I want to be able to find the cheapest drug (by unit price) in my list of favourite drugs
- As a user, I want to be able to return all drugs from the same class in my list
- As a user, I want to be able to update the cost of a drug to reflect any changes in pricing
